Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is abranch in computer science of computer science used for developin testing and maintaining software.
some of the importance in technology include;
 1.reliability -it ensures software performs as expected
 2.sscaability and flexibility-it ensures that the system can handle an increase in load without affecting it's performance
 3.efficiency-it helps to optimize developers workflow whilw maintaining high quality standards.
 4.security-implements protection practises like authentication authorization and encryption to secure user information 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.mastering complexity
2. mastering proces 
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning -identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification
design-build the framework
coding-converting software design into tangible code
testing -examine the softwarw for bugs



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.

 there is Low flexibility,

 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.

 Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.

 Testing is done at the end of the development process.
 agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).

High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.

  Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.

  Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.

 reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.

 create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow

 confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments and Version Control Systems in the software development process. Give examples of each.An integrated development environment is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for
automatically writing or editing the source code.

• An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.

• an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.

• IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changes in technology they can overcome this by staying up to date with current technology 
Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.

 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design anddevelop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.

Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.

Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.

 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present
there's increase flexibility 
there's developer control 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
quote a book
quote a text from the book A doll's House on page 59
the improved prompt is more clear concise and clear
